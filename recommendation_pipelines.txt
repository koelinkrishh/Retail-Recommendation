### Complete Step-by-Step Project Pipeline (14 Steps)

1. **Problem Definition**
   - Task: Build a product recommendation system for household items, similar to Walmart.
   - Goal: Recommend items to users based on past purchases, items in cart, and general association rules.

2. **Data Collection**
   - Use a retail transaction dataset (like UCI Online Retail, or other open datasets).
   - Each record should have: `customer_id`, `transaction_id`, `product_name`, `quantity`, `price`, `transaction_date`.

3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Clean product names (remove duplicates, standardize text).
   - Remove returns/canceled transactions (common in retail datasets).
   - Handle missing values (drop or impute).
   - Convert timestamps to `datetime` format.

4. **Transaction Structuring**
   - Group by `transaction_id` → get list of items per basket/visit.
   - Maintain `customer_id` → for personalization later.

5. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Count unique customers, items, transactions.
   - Plot top items purchased.
   - Look at seasonality (optional if timestamps available).

6. **Association Rule Mining (Apriori/FP-Growth)**
   - Use market basket analysis to find frequent itemsets.
   - Generate rules of form `A → B` with support, confidence, lift.
   - This gives "items often bought together".

7. **Collaborative Filtering Setup**
   - Build a customer–item matrix (rows = customers, columns = items, values = purchase counts or 0/1).
   - Apply models:
     - User-based CF (find similar users).
     - Item-based CF (find items frequently bought together across customers).
     - Matrix factorization (SVD, ALS, etc.).

8. **Personalization Layer (Your Damping Factor Idea)**
   - Store past purchase counts per customer in a dictionary:  
     `{customer_id: {item_name: purchase_count}}`
   - Apply scaling to boost priority of items they purchase frequently:  
     `priority = base_score * f(purchase_count)`  
     where `f` is a damping function like log(1+x).

9. **Hybrid Recommendation Engine**
   - Combine Association Rules (cart-level recommendations) with Collaborative Filtering (history-based recommendations).
   - Weighting:
     - Items from association rules: based on confidence/lift.
     - Items from CF: based on similarity scores.
     - Adjust with personalization damping factor.

10. **Ranking & Filtering**
    - Merge recommendation scores from different sources.
    - Apply filters:
      - Remove items already in cart (unless replenishable).
      - Filter by category (household items only).

11. **Evaluation**
    - Offline metrics:
      - Precision@k, Recall@k, NDCG (normalized discounted cumulative gain).
      - Coverage of recommendations across catalog.
    - Online (if deployed):
      - A/B testing with CTR (Click-Through Rate), Conversion, Basket size.

12. **Deployment Prep**
    - Package into API (FastAPI/Flask).
    - Endpoints:
      - `/recommend?customer_id=...`
      - `/recommend?cart_items=...`

13. **User Interface (Optional but Nice)**
    - Simple web app showing product recommendations for a user.
    - Could scrape product images/links from Walmart/Amazon for demo.

14. **Future Improvements**
    - Context-aware recommendations (time of day, seasonality).
    - Sequence modeling (RNNs, Transformers for next-basket prediction).
    - Real-time updating with new transactions.

### Detailed 20-Step Recommendation Pipeline

#### **Stage 1 – Data Foundation**
1. **Define Objective Clearly**
   - Recommend household items (like Walmart).  
   - Recommendation types:
     - *Cart-based* (what goes with items in cart).
     - *User-based* (personalized history).

2. **Acquire Data**
   - Start with **UCI Online Retail II dataset** (cleaner than v1).  
   - Fields: `InvoiceNo`, `StockCode`, `Description`, `Quantity`, `InvoiceDate`, `UnitPrice`, `CustomerID`.

3. **Initial Cleaning**
   - Remove canceled transactions (InvoiceNo starting with ‘C’).  
   - Drop missing CustomerIDs.  
   - Standardize item names.

4. **Transaction Structuring**
   - Group by `InvoiceNo` → basket = list of items.  
   - Link each basket to a `CustomerID`.

#### **Stage 2 – Exploratory Understanding**
5. **Basic EDA**
   - Unique customers, items, transactions.  
   - Top-N most purchased items.  
   - Customer purchase distribution.

6. **Visualizations**
   - Heatmap of customer vs items (sparse).  
   - Item popularity distribution (long-tail).

#### **Stage 3 – Association Rule Mining**
7. **Frequent Itemset Mining**
   - Apply Apriori or FP-Growth on baskets.  
   - Get frequent itemsets with minimum support.

8. **Generate Rules**
   - Rules of form `A → B`.  
   - Keep top rules by confidence & lift.

9. **Rule-Based Recommendations**
   - If cart has {milk, bread} → system recommends {butter}.

#### **Stage 4 – Collaborative Filtering**
10. **Matrix Construction**
    - Customer–item purchase matrix (values = frequency).

11. **Modeling Options**
    - User-based CF (similar customers).  
    - Item-based CF (similar items).  
    - Matrix factorization (SVD/ALS).

12. **Prediction**
    - Fill missing cells with estimated purchase likelihood.

#### **Stage 5 – Personalization Layer**
13. **User Purchase History Dictionary**
    - Example:  
      `{ "cust_123": {"milk": 5, "bread": 2, "butter": 7} }`

14. **Damping Function Scaling**
    - Modify recommendation score:  
      `final_score = base_score * f(purchase_count)`  
    - Functions: log(1+x), sqrt(x), x/(1+x), tanh(x), min(x, cap).

15. **Balance Exploration vs Exploitation**
    - Ensure not only frequent items are recommended.  
    - Add diversity penalty or popularity boost.

#### **Stage 6 – Hybrid Engine**
16. **Combine Association + CF + Personalization**
    - Weighted ensemble:  
      `final_score = w1*assoc + w2*CF + w3*personalized`.

17. **Ranking & Filtering**
    - Rank items by final_score.  
    - Remove already purchased / in-cart items.  
    - Keep only household-related categories.

#### **Stage 7 – Deployment**
18. **Evaluation**
    - Offline: Precision@k, Recall@k, MAP, NDCG.  
    - Online: CTR, conversion uplift, basket size.

19. **API Deployment**
    - Flask/FastAPI with endpoints:  
      - `/recommend/cart?items=[...]`  
      - `/recommend/user?customer_id=...`

20. **UI/Prototype**
    - Simple web dashboard.  
    - Show recommended items + images (scraped via API).  
    - Clickable links to simulate purchase flow.
