"""
In an end-to-end Machine Learning (ML) project, the __init__.py file is typically created inside the src/ folder to treat it as a package. Here's why it's important:

✅ Ensures the src folder is treated as a package
✅ Prevents import errors
✅ Keeps the project organized
✅ Allows custom initialization if needed
✅ Facilitates packaging & deployment
